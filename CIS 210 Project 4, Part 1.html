  <h1>Project 4, Part 1</h1>
<p>This assignment is due Friday, October 21 at 5pm. Save your Python program
  in a file called jumbler.py and turn that file in using Canvas.</p>
<h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>A common programming task is to scan a file, picking out elements that
     meet some criterion.
     This assignment introduces the file-scan idiom in Python, along with some
     basic manipulation of strings (text).
</p>

<h1>Word Jumbles (Anagrams)</h1>

  <p>
    Anagrams are words whose letters have been scrambled.
    In newspapers and online, "word jumble" puzzles are based on anagrams,
    and can be solved using the program you will write.
    (For example, you should be able to solve the anagrams at
    <a href="http://www.jumble.com/games/info/13">the daily jumble</a>.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="item">
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>
    Your program will read two strings from the command line.
    The first is a scrambled word (e.g., "hinttree").
    The second is the name of a file containing a list of words,
    which will serve as a dictionary.
    Your program will check the scrambled word against every word in the
    dictionary.
    If the scrambled word can be rearranged to match a dictionary word,
    the dictionary word will be printed.
    After scanning the whole word list, the program prints the number of
    matches and the number of words in the list.  For example:
  </p>
  <code>
  $ python3 jumbler.py trsesi dict.txt
  resist
  sister
  2 matches in 41238 words
  $ python3 jumbler.py rayin dict.txt
  rainy
  1 match in 41238 words
  $ python3 jumbler.py tororo dict.txt
  No matches
  $ python3 jumbler.py taroro dict.txt
  orator
  1 match in 41238 words
  $
  </code>
  <p>
    Note that 41238 is the number of words found in that particular dictionary.
    We could also run the program with a shorter or longer dictionary
    (by typing a different file name in place of dict.txt),
    and would see a different word count.
  </p>
  <code>
  $ python3 jumbler.py phaal shortdict.txt
  alpha
  1 match in 5 words
  </code>

  <h1>Notes and hints on the jumble solver</h1>
  <p>
    Please name your program file <tt>jumbler.py</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've provided some starter code in <a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/jumbler.py">jumbler.py</a>.
    Note there are several parts you need to change. Some are flagged with
    FIXME, some are not.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="item">
  <h2>How to check</h2>
  <p>
    There is a simple trick for matching anagrams in a word list - we sort
    the letters in the anagram (e.g., "trscsi" becomes "cirsst"),
    and we also sort the letters in each dictionary word before checking.
    Then, we can simply check to see if they match exactly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: when python reads a line of text from a file, the line includes
    the ending carriage return and/or newline character.
    That's why we strip "white space" off the ends of each entry in the
    dictionary file this way:
  </p>
  <code>
  word = word.strip()  # Remove spaces or carriage return at ends
  </code>
  <p>
    Python has a built-in function called <tt>sorted</tt> which puts any
    sequence into sorted order.
    A string in Python is an immutable sequence, so you can use the
    <tt>sorted</tt> function to get the letters in a word in alphabetical
    order.
    The <tt>sorted</tt> function always returns a <em>list</em>, so for
    example <tt>sorted("resist")</tt> will return
    <tt>["e", "i", "r", "s", "s", "t"]</tt>.
    Since we can check equality between lists, this feature of <tt>sorted</tt>
    works fine.
    For example, if we check <tt>sorted("abc") == sorted("cba")</tt>,
    we will be comparing <tt>["a", "b", "c"]</tt> to <tt>["a", "b", "c"]</tt>,
    and the result will be <tt>True</tt>.
  </p>
    You'll need a good word list to test your program.
    <a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/assignments/base/dict.txt">dict.txt</a> will work.
    Put it into the same directory as your program for easy testing.
    Don't turn it in with your program.
  <p>
  </p>
    You can find lots of test cases by searching for jumble or word jumble
    on the web.

<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>35 points possible</p>
  <ul>
    <li>15: Program runs and consistently produces correct
    output for any scrambled word and any dictionary.  5 point penalty for
    any of the following:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Test cases running in addition to program functionality. (You need
          to comment out the call to run_tests for your final testing and
          submission.)</li>
      <li>Incorrect or missing counts of matches or items in the word list.</li>
      <li>Other extra output, missing output, or output formatted differently
          than the examples above.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>10: Follows <a href="https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu/16F/cis210/handouts/styleguide.php">CIS 210 coding
        guidelines</a>, including author identification and header.</li>
    <li>10: Clarity. The program shouldnot only be consistent with the
        requirements and approach described here, but it should be very easy
        to read the program and verify its consistency with the spec.</li>
   </ul>
